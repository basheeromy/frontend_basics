            <br><strong><em>em </em></strong>command will make letters <em>italic</em>
            <br>We can also use <b>b</b> and<b><i> i</i></b>  for making letters bold and italic, but these are just

        <h3>Story</h3>
        <p>A short story is a piece of prose fiction that typically can be read in one sitting and focuses on a self-contained 
            incident or series of linked incidents, with the intent of evoking a single effect or mood. The short story is one 
            of the oldest types of literature and has existed in the form of legends, mythic tales, folk tales, fairy tales, tall
             tales, fables and anecdotes in various ancient communities around the world. The modern short story developed in the early 19th century.</p>
        <p>The short story is a crafted form in its own right. Short stories make use of plot, resonance, and other dynamic components as in a novel, but 
            typically to a lesser degree. While the short story is largely distinct from the novel or novella/short novel, authors generally draw from a 
            common pool of literary techniques.[citation needed] The short story is sometimes referred to as a genre.[1]</p>
        <p>Determining what exactly defines a short story has been recurrently problematic.[2] A classic definition of a short story is that one should be
             able to read it in one sitting, a point most notably made in Edgar Allan Poe's essay "The Philosophy of Composition" (1846).[3] H.G. Wells 
             described the purpose of the short story as "The jolly art, of making something very bright and moving; it may be horrible or pathetic or 
             funny or profoundly illuminating, having only this essential, that it should take from fifteen to fifty minutes to read aloud."[4] According 
             to William Faulkner, a short story is character driven and a writer's job is to "...trot along behind him with a paper and pencil trying to 
             keep up long enough to put down what he says and does.‚Äù[5]</p>
        <p>During what is known as Marvel's Timely era, Captain America was licensed out to Republic Pictures for a serial just for the free advertising.
             Timely failed to provide any drawing of Captain America with his shield or any further background, and Republic created a whole new background
              for the character, and portrayed the character using a gun.[6]

        <p><h3><strong></a><a href="Marvel.html">Marvel</a></strong></h3>Entertainment Group era[edit]
            From the late 1970s through the early 1990s, Marvel Entertainment Group (MEG) sold options to studios to produce films based on Marvel Comics characters.
             One of Marvel's superheroes, Spider-Man, was optioned in the late 1970s, and rights reverted to Marvel without a film having been produced within the 
             allocated timeframe. From 1986 to 1996, most of Marvel's major characters had been optioned, including the Fantastic Four, X-Men, Daredevil, Hulk, Silver 
             Surfer, and Iron Man.[7] A Howard the Duck film made it to the screen in 1986, but was a box-office flop. MEG was purchased by New World Entertainment in 
             November 1986[8] and moved to produce films based on the Marvel characters. It released The Punisher (1989) before MEG was sold to Ronald Perelman's Andrews Group.
              Two other films were produced: Captain America (1990) released in the United Kingdom on screens and direct to video in the United States, and The Fantastic Four 
              (1994), not intended for release.[9]</p>
